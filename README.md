# Creating my first endpoint with node js.

Next we have an api which has 3 endpoints available:

- Get: to get all the records made
- Get/: id: to obtain a specific record using the id.
- Post: to create a new record

example:
 [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "date": "2017-01-01",
        "weather": "rainy",
        "visibility": "poor",
        "comment": "Pretty scary flight, I'm glad I'm alive"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "date": "2017-04-01",
        "weather": "sunny",
        "visibility": "good",
        "comment": "Everything went better than expected, I'm learning much"
    }
]
